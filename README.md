# Luminaire
Requires Unity 2019.3.12f. Currently untested on other versions.

# Installation
The repository should be openable as a Unity project.

# Usage
The first time you open Luminaire, you need to point it to your game directory. Go to Edit>Preferences>Luminaire and select the game's executable.

Once Luminaire is configured, you can import Entity Packages (.exml files) by going to Luminaire>Import Entity Package.

# Limitations
* Entity Package exporting is yet to be implemented.
* Some property types still aren't properly supported.
